		Our next meeting will be a picnic in Golden Gate Park on Sunday, August twentieth. We will be in the meadow near Fulton and 30th Avenue. On the twenty-seventy we will resume regular meetings at the church of St. John the Evangelist, 1661 15th Street in San Francisco, near the 16th Street Mission bart.
