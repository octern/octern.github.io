		Our next meeting will be Sunday, June eighteenth from one thirty to three thirty PM. We will be at the The Episcopal Church of St. John the Evangelist, 1661 15th Street in San Francisco, near the 16th Street Mission bart.
		Note that we will not have a meeting on June twenty-fifth so that ISF members can participate in the Pride parade and festival. Again, our upcoming meeting will happen on schedule but the meeting after that one is canceled.
